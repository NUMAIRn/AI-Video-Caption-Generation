The process involves the following steps:


*   **Frame Extraction:**

For every second of the video, the function captures the first frame.
For example, if the video is 10 seconds long and operates at 30 frames per second (fps), it will extract frames from the following positions: the 1st frame (0 seconds), the 31st frame (1 second), the 61st frame (2 seconds), and so on. This ensures that each frame corresponds to the start of a new second of the video.

*   **Caption Generation:**

Each extracted frame is then processed using a pre-trained image captioning model called "*nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning.*"
The model analyzes the content of each frame and generates a descriptive caption that summarizes what is happening in that particular moment.


*   **Overlaying Captions:**

Finally, the generated captions are overlayed onto the video frames using the OpenCV library.
This creates a visual representation of the captions, allowing viewers to read along with the action in the video as it unfolds.
